            <h1>Calendar in C</h1>
            <p>This paper presents a comprehensive Calendar Program written in the C programming
            language. The program provides a user-friendly interface to manage and manipulate dates, events, and
            reminders. It includes features such as displaying a monthly calendar, adding, modifying, and deleting
            events, and setting reminders for specific dates.
            <br>
            The program is designed to be efficient and easy to use. It uses a structured approach to manage data, with
            separate structures for dates, events, and reminders. The program also includes functions for various
            operations, such as adding a new event, deleting an existing event, and displaying the calendar for a
            specific month.
            <br>
            The program uses the standard input/output functions in C for user interaction. It also uses the time.h
            library for date and time manipulation.
            <br>
            The program is tested thoroughly to ensure its correctness and efficiency. It handles edge cases and invalid
            inputs gracefully, providing appropriate error messages to the user.
            <br>
            The Calendar Program in C serves as a practical example of how to implement complex data structures and
            algorithms in C. It demonstrates the power and flexibility of the C language in handling real-world
            applications.

            <h1>Bookstore Inventory</h1>
            <p>This paper presents a comprehensive Bookstore Inventory Management System developed in C++. The system is
            designed to manage and manipulate the inventory of a bookstore, including tracking the number of books in
            stock, adding new books, updating the inventory when a book is sold, and deleting books from the inventory.
            <br>
            The system uses a structured approach to manage data, with separate structures for books and inventory. It
            includes functions for various operations, such as adding a new book, updating the inventory, and displaying
            the inventory.
            <br>
            The system uses the standard input/output functions in C++ for user interaction. It also uses file handling
            for persistent storage of the inventory data.
            <br>
            The system is tested thoroughly to ensure its correctness and efficiency. It handles edge cases and invalid
            inputs gracefully, providing appropriate error messages to the user.
            <br>
            The Bookstore Inventory Management System in C++ serves as a practical example of how to implement complex
            data structures and algorithms in C++. It demonstrates the power and flexibility of the C++ language in
            handling real-world applications.

            <h1>Binary Search in 8086 processor</h1>
            <p>This paper presents a detailed study on the implementation of the Binary Search algorithm on the 8086
            microprocessor. Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It
            works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until the possible
            range is narrowed down to zero.
            <br>
            The implementation of Binary Search on the 8086 processor involves the use of assembly language programming.
            The algorithm is implemented as a subroutine, which takes an array of sorted integers and a target integer
            as input, and returns the index of the target integer in the array if it is present, or -1 if it is not.
            <br>
            The paper provides a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm, along with the corresponding assembly code.
            It also includes a discussion on the time complexity of the Binary Search algorithm, and its advantages and
            disadvantages compared to other search algorithms.
            <br>
            The implementation of Binary Search on the 8086 processor serves as a practical example of how to implement
            complex algorithms on low-level hardware. It demonstrates the power and flexibility of assembly language
            programming in handling real-world applications.

            <h1>Language interpreter using PY4J</h1>
            <p>This paper presents a detailed study on the development of a Language Interpreter using PY4J, a Python to
            Java Gateway. The Language Interpreter is a program that executes programs written in a specific programming
            language.
            <br>
            The implementation of the Language Interpreter involves the use of PY4J, which allows Python programs to
            call Java code seamlessly. The interpreter is designed to interpret a simple programming language, with
            features such as variable assignment, arithmetic operations, and conditional statements.
            <br>
            The paper provides a step-by-step explanation of the interpreter, along with the corresponding Python and
            Java code. It also includes a discussion on the design and implementation of the interpreter, and its
            capabilities and limitations.
            <br>
            The development of the Language Interpreter using PY4J serves as a practical example of how to integrate
            different programming languages using a bridge like PY4J. It demonstrates the power and flexibility of PY4J
            in handling real-world applications.
